## What are CLion and Cygwin?

CLion is an IDE program created by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/). CLion allows users to code in both C and C++ computer languages, for this document we will guide you towards using this IDE to code in C. JetBrains offers the use of CLions with a 30-day free trial.

To use CLion, you will need to install another program called [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). Cygwin contains large collections of open source tools that will allow you to effectively code in the CLion IDE. For the use of CLion, we will be using Cygwin to download and use:
- _gcc-g++_
- _gdb_
- _make_

## Prerequisites
To start following the instructions in this document, you will need: 

**Note:** This guide was not made specifically for Mac users, as both the creators of this document are Windows users.

- access to a computer
- any version of Windows (preferrably version 10)
- an internet connection to download the setups, and
- that's all!

## Is This Guide For You?
This document was made for any user who wishes to code in C, both experienced and inexperienced.
<br/><br/>
If you are interested in coding, and wish to start off by downloading the right programming IDE, then this document is for you!

## Why Use CLion Over Other Programming IDES?
CLion offers an abundance of useful features and tips that will help you become a strong coding developer.
<br/><br/>
This includes:
- a debugger
- an error detector
- a code editor to help refactor and refine your code
- automatic code generator
- personal customizations
- and much more!
<br/>
All of these will help improve any coder, regardless of experience. And with a 30-day free trial, it would be a waste to not make use of this IDE!
