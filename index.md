# Introduction

The instructions inside this document will guide you to installing, setting up, and using Cygwin to program in the CLion Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This manual is for any users, beginner or experienced, who wish to begin coding using the C language. This document will help guide users of all computer level skills. Any unknown vocabulary will be covered in the [Glossary](https://go-maun.github.io/Keegan-Lawrance-User-Documentation/docs/index-test/).


### What is CLion?


CLion is an IDE program created by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/). CLion allows users to code in both C and C++ computer languages, for this document we will guide you towards using this IDE to code in C. JetBrains offers the use of CLions with a 30-day free trial, and a $199.99 fee for the first year of purchase, so make use of your free trial while it lasts!

To use CLion, you will need to install another program called [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). Cygwin contains large collections of open source tools that will allow you to effectively code in the CLion IDE. For the use of CLion, we will be using Cygwin to download and use:
1. [gcc-g++] (EDITORS NOTE: Add link for definition)
2. [gdb] (EDITORS NOTE: Add link for definition)
3. [make] (EDITORS NOTE: Add link for definition)
