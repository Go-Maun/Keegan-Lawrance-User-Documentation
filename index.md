## What is CLion?

CLion is an IDE program created by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/). CLion allows users to code in both C and C++ computer languages, for this document we will guide you towards using this IDE to code in C. JetBrains offers the use of CLions with a 30-day free trial, and a $199.99 fee for the first year of purchase, so make use of your free trial while it lasts!

To use CLion, you will need to install another program called [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). Cygwin contains large collections of open source tools that will allow you to effectively code in the CLion IDE. For the use of CLion, we will be using Cygwin to download and use:
- gcc-g++
- gdb
- make
