# README for Cygwin and CLion User Document

These instructions will help guide a user towards running CLion using a Cygwin library.

Through the process of downloading both Cygwin and CLion multiple times, we were able to refine our instructions to ensure that our instructions can be understood by anyone.

With the use of markdown with some HTML tags, we spent time creating an appealing dosument to follow along with that is easy to navigate. We used paint.net to edit the screenshots to make steps as easy as possible to follow for our users.
