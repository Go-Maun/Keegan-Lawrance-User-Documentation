# README for Cygwin and CLion User Document

These instructions will help guide a user towards running CLion using a Cygwin library.

We went through the process of downloading both Cygwin and CLion multiple times to refine our instruction set.

We used markdown with some HTML incorperation to create the 6 webpages for this assignment.
We used paint.ned to edit the screenshots.
