# Overview
This document was written for the purpose of guiding people through the process of gathering the needed packages from Cygwin to run C in Clion. The document covers:

* Downloading Cygwin and it's packages
* Creating an account to use CLion
* Downloading CLion and getting C running

# Developing Our Guide

Our primary sources for the production of this guide mainly came from "Writing in the Technical Fields: A Practical Guide" by Thorsten Ewald, and from our instructor, Sam Lee.

The process of creating instructions was broken into step-bt-step instructions, examining each step to make sure it would be easy to follow for any user, and that each step would be illustrated appropriately to guide the users eyes towards what is important for each step.

Our instructions for downloading Cygwin were created with help from our C teacher, Seyed Mohammad Javadi, and the instructions he gave us at the beginning of the term for downloading Cygwin. Our instructions for downloading and running CLion were created by following along with the downloading process also provided by Seyed, and creating a template for both processes that is easy to follow and very visual.

# Conclusion

We faced some challenges learning and using markdown for the first time, but the layout of our document ended up looking nice. The most dificult thing we faced was trying to get the ordered lists formatted properly, as we had a large handful of commits that were quickly changed due to incorrect step numbering.

We hope that you will find this document helpful, and that you can pass on this document to others who are wanting to get into coding with C and CLion.
